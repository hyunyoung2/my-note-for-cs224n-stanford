My note for [cs224n : Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning of stanford](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)

They are give you lecture video of 2017 winter version for people out of stanford. 

So I would study with [Lecture note](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/cs224n-winter17-notes) on 2017 winter version of CS224N, Because I have already heard of the youtube 0f 2017 version. 
This is just for review on my deep learning once again with 2017 and 2018 version of CS224n.
