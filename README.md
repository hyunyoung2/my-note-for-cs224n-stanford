# My not for [CS224n of Stanford](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)

After I finished taking this class, cs224n through [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6), Irealized I need to orgarnize this class note for me. 

From now on, I would repeat this class one more time.

As soon as I finish one class, I would organize what I learn into this respository. 

If you want to know about Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning, take this class, [cs224n of stanford](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)
